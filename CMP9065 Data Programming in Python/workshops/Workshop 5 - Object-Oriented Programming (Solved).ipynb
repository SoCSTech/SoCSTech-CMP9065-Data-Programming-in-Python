    "Object-oriented programming, as the name suggests, is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects and classes. Believe it or not, almost everything in Python is an object! Much like functional programming, the goal with OOP is to structure code into simple, resurable pieces of code blueprints (in this case called classes), but with OOP these are used to create individual instances called objects. As you'll see in our upcoming live coding, these classes and objects are generally used to represent real-life concepts (as an example, you might have a class that represents a person, or an animal, or a vehicle, etc). This paradigm is extremely commonly used in software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can be thought of as abstract blueprints that represent a concept or category (for example *User*, *File*, *Student*, but also *list* or *string*!), defining what ***attributes*** these concepts or categories should have - think of how every *User* has a *username*, every *Student* has a *study programme*, etc. Classes can also define what ***behaviours*** a concept or category should have - think of how you might *append* elements to a *list* in Python."
