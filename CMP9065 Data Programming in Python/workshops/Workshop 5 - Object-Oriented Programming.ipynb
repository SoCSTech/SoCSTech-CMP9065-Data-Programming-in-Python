    "Object-oriented programming, as the name suggests, is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects and classes. Believe it or not, almost everything in Python is an object! Much like functional programming, the goal with OOP is to structure code into simple, resurable pieces of code blueprints (in this case called classes), but with OOP these are used to create individual instances called objects. As you'll see in our upcoming live coding, these classes and objects are generally used to represent real-life concepts (as an example, you might have a class that represents a person, or an animal, or a vehicle, etc). This paradigm is extremely commonly used in software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can be thought of as abstract blueprints that represent a concept or category (for example *User*, *File*, *Student*, but also *list* or *string*!), defining what ***attributes*** these concepts or categories should have - think of how every *User* has a *username*, every *Student* has a *study programme*, etc. Classes can also define what ***behaviours*** a concept or category should have - think of how you might *append* elements to a *list* in Python."

(Joe)\" b) that `message` is a _string_ and that the `board` is of class `MessageBoard`"

We will implement a simple flagging system, where if a moderator flags a message for the first time, they append \"(FLAGGED by ModUsername) \" to that message (where the ModUsername is simply the `name` of that `User`/`Moderator`). If a moderator flags a message that has already been flagged (i.e. any message beginning with \"(FLAGGED by\", than that message is _deleted from the message board_.\n",

    "So, implement a `Moderator` class by doing the following:\n",
    "- change the solution to the previous exercise to `name` is **protected** but **not private**\n",
    "- implement a `Moderator` class which inherits from `User`\n",
    "- implement a **initialisation method** `__init__` which allows setting up the `Moderator` username, which simply calls the initialisation method of the `User` class (no checks needed, since the `User` class performs them!)\n",
    "- implement a **method** `flag_message` which allows flagging a message by index. The flagging behaviour is described above (in brief: prepend the words \"(FLAGGED by ModUsername) \" if not flagged already; or delete message if it has been already flagged and begins with the text \"(FLAGGED by\")\n",
