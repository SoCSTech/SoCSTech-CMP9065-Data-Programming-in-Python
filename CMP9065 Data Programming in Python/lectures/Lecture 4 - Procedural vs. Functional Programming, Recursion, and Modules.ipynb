    "## Procedural vs. Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, there are three primary \"programming paradigms\", referring to categories in which we can place certain programming languages based on their functionality/features. These categories are ***procedural programming languages***, ***functional programming languages***, and ***object-oriented programming languages***. It's important to note that many languages will be capable of implementing more than one of these paradigms - for example, Python is capable of all three - and the latter paradigm will be discussed in a following lecture as it is a rather broad topic (and a rather important topic). Let's go through the first two programming paradigms and discuss their differences with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedural Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "A procedural programming language is any programming language that allows (or requires) code to be written in ***procedures*** - also commonly referred to as ***routines***, ***subroutines*** or ***functions***. As the name might suggest, a procedure is essentially a set of instructions or computational steps to be ***executed in order***. In other words, you can think of procedural programming as being all about the idea of executing code as a sequence of steps - a step-by-step plan of action that needs to be executed in order to fulfil the task your code is meant to fulfil.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural code is not necessarily organised in any logical groupings or object-like entities (more on this when we cover object-oriented programming in an upcoming lecture), unlike the other paradigms. That is not to say that procedural code cannot utilise functions (which are a staple of functional programming languages) or other paradigm's features (such as objects) - as you'll see in upcoming examples - but more that procedural code should encapsulate a way of thinking about writing code that follows a linear, top-down approach where each program is designed as a series of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think of it is...  \n",
    "Functional programming focuses on ***expressions***.  \n",
    "Procedural programming focuses on ***statements***.\n",

This allows functions (like in the cell above) to work on their own copy of a variable without affecting the global state; modifying x inside the function does not modify x outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Global variables*** are a new concept for the module content so far; unlike local variables, global variables can be accessed anywhere in the program (they have a global scope) - these are usually defined outside of the main function, but can be initialized from inside any local scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: it is generally not recommended to use global variables where local variables can be used; you should aim to write the most \"maintainable\" code possible - that is, you need to find a balance between making things accessible while also preventing accidental collisions/modifications (more on this when we discuss public vs. private class variables when we cover object-oriented programming).  \n",
