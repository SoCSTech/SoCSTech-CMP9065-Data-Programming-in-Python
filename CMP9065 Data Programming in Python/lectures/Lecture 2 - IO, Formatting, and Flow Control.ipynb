Firstly, the in-built Python function type() prints, as the name suggests, the type of the given variable - we use type() here to show that the result of reading user input with input() is always, by default, a string. We also demonstrate simple type conversion using int(), float() and str() and how this can be useful. This is an example of ***explicit type conversion*** - there is also ***implicit type conversion*** which is when type conversion happens naturally as part of an existing process. You can also think of this as ***manual type conversion*** and ***automatic type conversion***. Let's have a look at a simple example:"
