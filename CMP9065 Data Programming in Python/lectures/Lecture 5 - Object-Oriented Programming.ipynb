    "## Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, there are three primary \"programming paradigms\", referring to categories in which we can place certain programming languages based on their functionality/features. These categories are ***procedural programming languages***, ***functional programming languages***, and ***object-oriented programming languages***. It's important to note that many languages will be capable of implementing more than one of these paradigms - for example, Python is capable of all three - and, as we've covered the first two now, it's time to dive into the latter paradigm, object-oriented programming. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a rather broad topic (and a rather important topic), so let's start by going through what exactly OOP is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming, as the name suggests, is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects and classes. Believe it or not, almost everything in Python is an object! Much like functional programming, the goal with OOP is to structure code into simple, resurable pieces of code blueprints (in this case called classes), but with OOP these are used to create individual instances called objects. As you'll see in our upcoming live coding, these classes and objects are generally used to represent real-life concepts (as an example, you might have a class that represents a person, or an animal, or a vehicle, etc). This paradigm is extremely commonly used in software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can be thought of as abstract blueprints that represent a concept or category (for example *User*, *File*, *Student*, but also *list* or *string*!), defining what ***attributes*** these concepts or categories should have - think of how every *User* has a *username*, every *Student* has a *study programme*, etc. Classes can also define what ***behaviours*** a concept or category should have - think of how you might *append* elements to a *list* in Python."

    "\n",
    "Instead of introducing the concept of a _class_ through examples such as *Animal*, or *Car* - trying to describe a real-world concept which is actually unlikely to be directly related to the real usage of the OOP paradigm - we will try to implement a simple set of classes to simulate file system on a computer. We will only allow *text files* and *folders* in our file system.\n",

This **better approach will be demonstrated in the today's workshop**._\n",

    "#### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation refers to the grouping/bundling of attributes and methods inside a single class, with the intention of restricting direct access to class/instance attributes to the methods of that class/instance. As with the other pillars, restricting user access to *only* things which they *need* to access (and restricting knowledge of the inner workings of methods when not needed) is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, while the handling of the `name` attribute is relatively straighforward - we only ever print it and assign it new values, notice that this would allow us to assign e.g. a _list_ to the `name` attribute and get around the checks we have implemented in the `rename` method. However, notice how much complicated our handling of `content` is, especially with the `Folder` class - we really _should not_ allow somebody to change the contents from the \"outside\", without using our `access_item`, `add_item` and `delete_item` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current _instance attributes_ are considered **public**: they can be accessed both outside of the class, and are fully inherited with the class. There are two ways to _hide instance attributes_ and implement **encapsulation**:\n",
    "- making the attribute **private** by adding a double underscore to the name, e.g. `__name` instead of `name`. This attribute will only be accessible inside the class, and **not even accessible to child-classes**\n",
    "- a slightly less restrictive option is *protected* members -- adding a single underscore, e.g. `_name` instead of `name`. This attribute will only be accessible inside the class and any classes that inherit it.\n",
    "- as neither private nor protected members are accessible outside of a class (you can no longer access it as `file.name`), it is customary to set _getter_ methods (e.g. `get_name`) to access their values, and _setter_ methods (e.g. `set_name` or in our case `rename`) where modifying the attributes directly appropriate (take care, this is _not_ appropriate for our `content` attribute)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see a complete example of our file system, implementing `SystemObject` class, the `TextFile` class _inheriting_ `SystemObject`, and the `Folder` class also _inheriting_ `SystemObject`, with proper _encapsulation_ added."
