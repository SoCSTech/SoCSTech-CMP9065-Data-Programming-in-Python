Some of these topics, particularly in an accelerated module like Data Programming in Python, can be a little more difficult to fully grasp compared to others. In this recap, we'll cover briefly **some of the main topics** that are commonly considered more difficult (or more important) amongst the topics covered so far. These will include **data types**, **functions**, **recursion**, **object-oriented programming** and **namespaces**. \n",

This recap will take the form of a set of \"can you predict the output\" code blocks, much like recaps from prior weeks. Nevertheless, I will explain the code cell in any instance where you don't seem sure about what the output could be (or how we got that output), so please ask if you're not sure about anything! Also, we will try and look at the documentations together so that you become familiar with exploring it on your own.\n"
